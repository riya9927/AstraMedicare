## Full Stack Doctor Appointment Booking System

Developed a full-stack Doctor Appointment Booking System using the MERN stack, designed to streamline the online consultation experience for patients, doctors, and admins. The application features three-level authentication for Patients, Doctors, and Admins. Patients can book, reschedule, or cancel appointments, view health records, and make payments online. Doctors can manage appointments, earnings, and update profiles, while Admins oversee system-wide activity and doctor management.
